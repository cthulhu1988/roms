        Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) is a legal
        agreement between you, the end-user, Id Software, Inc.
        (&quot;ID&quot;) and Activision, Inc.
        (&quot;Activision&quot;). By continuing the installation
        of this game program entitled QUAKE II, by loading or
        running the game program, or by placing or copying the
        game program onto your computer hard drive, computer RAM
        or other storage, you are agreeing to be bound by the
        terms of this Agreement. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">1. Grant of License for Software.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ID
        grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right to use
        the software game program entitled QUAKE II in executable
        or object code form only (the &quot;Software&quot;) for
        recreational purposes only. The term &quot;Software&quot;
        includes all elements of the Software such as data files,
        images appearing in the Software and screen displays. You
        are not receiving any ownership or proprietary right,
        title or interest in or to the Software or the copyright,
        trademarks, or other rights related thereto. For purposes
        of this section, &quot;use&quot; means loading the
        Software into RAM and/or onto computer hard drive, as
        well as installation of the Software on a hard disk or
        other storage device. You agree that the Software will
        not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country
        in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or
        any other law governing such matters) by you or any one
        at your direction and that you will not utilize and will
        not authorize anyone to utilize, in any other manner, the
        Software in violation of any applicable law. The Software
        may not be exported or reexported into (or to a national
        or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has
        embargoed goods or to anyone or into any country
        who/which are prohibited, by applicable law, from
        receiving such property.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">2. Additional Levels. Subject to the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement, ID grants to you
        the non-exclusive and limited right to create additional
        levels (the &quot;Levels&quot;) which are operable with
        the Software. You may include within the Levels certain
        textures and other images (the &quot;ID Images&quot;)
        from the Software. You agree that the Levels will not be
        shipped, transferred or exported into any country in
        violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any
        other law governing such matters) by you or anyone at
        your direction and that you will not utilize and will not
        authorize anyone to utilize, in any other manner, the
        Levels in violation of any applicable law. The Levels may
        not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported
        into (or to a national or resident of) any country to
        which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to anyone or into

        As noted below, in the event you commercially distribute
        or commercial exploit the Levels or commit any other
        breach of this Agreement, your licenses, as granted in
        this Agreement, shall automatically terminate, without

        Levels and/or the distribution or other use of the
        Levels. </font></p>

        seq. and other applicable law. You agree to use your best
        efforts to see that any user of the Software licensed
        hereunder, the Printed Materials or the Levels complies
        with this Agreement. You agree that you are receiving a
        copy of the Software, including the ID Images, and the
        Printed Material by license only and not by sale and that
        the &quot;first sale&quot; doctrine of 17 U.S.C. §109
        does not apply to your receipt or use of the Software,
        the Printed Materials or your inclusion of any ID Images
        in the Levels. This section 5. shall survive the
        cancellation or termination of this Agreement.</font></p>

        MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
        SUCH AS PRESENTATIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, DO NOT
        CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES BY ID AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED
        UPON. This section 6. shall survive the cancellation or
        termination of this Agreement. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">7. Limited Activision Warranty.
        Activision warrants to the original consumer purchaser of
        the Software that the recording medium on which the
        Software is recorded will be free from defects in
        material and workmanship for 90 days from the date of
        purchase. If the recording medium is found defective
        within 90 days of original purchase, Activision agrees to
        replace, free of charge, any product discovered to be
        defective within such period upon its receipt of the
        product, postage paid, with proof of the date of
        purchase, as long as the Software is still being
        manufactured by Activision. In the event that the
        Software is no longer available, Activision retains the
        right to substitute a similar program of equal or greater
        value. This warranty is limited to the recording medium
        containing the Software as originally provided by
        Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear.
        This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void
        if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or
        neglect. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THIS WARRANTY IS IN
        LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR

        intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
        Failure of ID or Activision to enforce any provision of
