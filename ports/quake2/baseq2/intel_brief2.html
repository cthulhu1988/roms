        </strong></font><font size="2">The core of the Stroggos
        civilization is the capital city of Cerberon. The highly
        defended complex is built into the base of an enormous
        crater named Crater Majoris. Between the northern plains
        and the southern sea of Stroggos, Cerberon contains the
        major defense, communication, and political controls for
        the Strogg civilization. At the southern tip of Majoris
        is a second crater called Crater Minor. Crater Minor
        contains the defense base complex for the city of
        Cerberon. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>[Political
        Structure] </strong></font><font size="2"><br>
        The Strogg civilization is governed through a system of
        Warlords. Each is given strategic locations to command
        and control. A single leader, called the Makron, is
        chosen from the Warlords. He commands Stroggos from
        within the palace city located at the northern end of
        Cerberon. Losing him would leave the Strogg confused and
        in turmoil as the Warlords battle internally to determine
        a successor. This would remove any chance Stroggos has
        for creating a well-organized strike or defensive
        position. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>[Defense Systems] </strong></font><font
        size="2"><br>
        Guarding Stroggos is a defense system we refer to as the
        Big Gun. This defense system detects and destroys any
        ship over a few meters in length. Also, to protect
        against ground assaults, a deadly laser security grid
        surrounds the entire capital city.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>[Energy Resources]
        </strong></font><font size="2"><br>
        Bluish crystals called Steedium are the source for most
        of the energy that powers Stroggos. The energy gained
        from processing these crystals provides them with the
        power run their entire civilization as well as their
        planetary defense weapons systems (a.k.a. the Big Gun).</font></p>
