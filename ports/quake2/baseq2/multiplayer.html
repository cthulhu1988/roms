        &quot;Multiplayer&quot; allows multiple players to enter
        a game together, over the Internet or on your local area
        network.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The most popular way to play Quake II
        Multiplayer is a Deathmatch, which has no monsters, just
        player versus player! The goal of the game is to kill
        your opponents more often than they kill you. Each kill
        counts for one &quot;frag&quot;, and if you kill yourself
        then you lose a frag, thus it's not a great idea to go
        swimming in the lava or juggle your own grenades.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Another multiplayer mode is Cooperative
        or &quot;co-op&quot;. In a co-op game up to four players
        can join in a game to combate the monsters of Stroggos as
        team. The rules for this method of play are similar to a
        single player game, except up to four people can go after
        the enemy together.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After you die, press the Space Bar to
        reappear, or &quot;respawn&quot;, in the game.
        You&#146;ll be brought back at one of several random
        respawn locations. Throughout the map you will find
        different artifacts, such as weapons, ammo, health and
        powerups, that are needed to be successful at destroying
        your enemy. When starting a Quake II Multiplayer Server,
        you have the option of making weapons disappear when you
        pick them up and respawn after time (length of time
        depends on item), or they can be made to stay put at all
        times so your Deathmatch experience is a true fragfest!</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Under the JOIN SERVER menu are two
        options that will help you locate and join in network
        games. The first is &quot;address book&quot;, which is
        used to store and recall the IP addresses or hostnames of
        Internet servers. A good starting place for finding
        servers to add to your address book can be found at
        http://www.idsoftware.com/q2multiplayer. The second
        option you have is &quot;search for servers&quot;, which
        will display a list of servers running on your local area
        network as well as any you have entered into your address
        book.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To add servers to your address book,
        simply move down to an available spot and type in the
        hostname or IP address of the server. To join a server
        that is listed in your address book highlight that server
        and hit ENTER.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To search for and connect to a server
        on your local area network simply select SEARCH FOR
        SERVERS, then press ENTER on any of the servers that
        appear under &quot;connect to...&quot;.</font></p>

                which make the game behave differently. When you

                below, hit ENTER on BEGIN to launch your server.
                Once the server is running other players can join

        depends on the following two options.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">TIME LIMIT: Set the number of minutes
        that the game will run before advancing to the next map.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">FRAG LIMIT: Once any player attains
        this number of frags the game will automatically advance
        to the next map.</font></p>

        up a player. This does not apply to other artifacts, such
        as ammo, health and powerups.</font></p>

        the moment you pick them up when this is set to YES.</font></p>

        whether powerups show up in the map.</font></p>

        skins to choose from. For team play, all team mates
        should select the same skin.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">HANDEDNESS: Switches your weapon
        between right and left hand views. Also allows a center
        aligned mode where no weapon is drawn. Center is often
        easier to aim, and because no weapon is drawn the game
        will run faster.</font></p>

        the console (hit the ~ key) and type SERVERINFO you will
        get back a list of the current settings for the server
        you are connected to. This list includes such things as
