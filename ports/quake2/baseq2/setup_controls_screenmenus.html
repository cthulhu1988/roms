        </font><font size="2">The goals of Quake II are divided
        into a series of complex missions or objectives. During
        the game your field computer provides you with each new
        objective. It is important to regularly review this
        information. The Intel Brief section of this manual
        describes general information on your missions,
        environment, weapons, special items, and alien profiles.<br>

        <br>
        Quake II contains eight large units, each with a number
        of levels to complete in order to proceed to the next
        unit. It is likely you will have to go between levels
        several times to accomplish a particular goal. Remember
        that once you leave a unit you cannot return unless you
        reload a saved game from that unit. Therefore it is
        important to review your field computer to be sure you
        accomplished all of your goals for that unit. <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>* Note on
        Units</strong></font><font size="2">: If you wish to play
        a particular unit, without working your way through all
        the levels preceding that unit, you can. We do not
        recommend that you jump into the middle of the game or
        skip any levels, since Quake II was designed in a
        progressive manner, and each level is important to the
        unfolding of the entire game. However, if you want to
        just play through a particular unit, you can 'exec' a
        file which will launch the level and give you the
        appropriate weapons and ammo to start with for that unit.
        To do this, simply pull down the console by pressing the
        tilde ( ~ ) key, and type the following command for the
        respective unit you wish to start:<br>

        interesting fashion (multiplayer games). Certain messages
        will appear in the middle of the screen. These are always
        important, and you do not want to ignore them! Examples

        down the jump key. To get out of the drink, swim toward
        the shore and you can either jump up onto the land or
        walk straight out if it is shallow enough. There is
