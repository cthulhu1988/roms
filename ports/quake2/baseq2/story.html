        </div><p><font size="2">Long shadows claw desperately
        away from your dusty combat boots, fueled by the
        relentless sun of a late Texas afternoon. Shading your
        eyes against the glare, you squint for the thousandth
        time at the line of soldiers ahead of you. It stretches
        on endlessly across the rubble, disappearing at last into
        the cool shadows of a troop carrier. Soon you&#146;ll
        walk up the ramp into the ship, climb into your one-man
        cocoon, tear through the interplanetary gateway, and
        smash down light-years away from the blowing sand and
        blasted ruins that surround the Dallas-Metro crater.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;What the hell is taking so
        long?!&quot; you snarl, slamming the battered barrel of
        your side arm, the blaster, against your scarred palm.
        &quot;I&#146;ve waited long enough. Time to kick some
        Strogg ass&#133;&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Slightly rocking back and forth under
        the sweltering August sun, you spit out of the side of
        your mouth, rub your eyes, and think back to the day when
        the wretched creatures first attacked. Like flaming
        meteors, their crafts pounded into the Earth and
        unbelievably, these bio-mechanical aliens&#133; these
        hideous cyborgs&#133; swarmed out while their ships still
        sizzled with reentry heat. They killed or captured
        anything that lived. We figured that the Strogg were
        after our planet&#146;s resources: minerals, metals, and
        water: things like that. But their onboard storage
        facilities did little to disguise what they considered to
        be resources: fleshy limbs and organs for new cyborgs,
        and of course, food. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The line moves. And moves again. Into
        the cool shadows at last. The assembled armies branch off
        into new lines divided by corps and unit. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;I can&#146;t deal with this shit
        &#150; what&#146;s the friggin&#146; hold-up?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;Cool your jets, marine,&quot;
        Tokay mutters and smiles over his shoulder.
        &quot;We&#146;ll all get a few Strogg heads to take home
        as souvenirs. I promise you that.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;Yo, soldier, 3585.&quot; The
        medtech&#146;s voice startles you. &quot;You in or
        out?&quot; Competent hands guide you into the coffin-like
        opening of your Mark 9A drop pod: sleek, dark, and
        invisible to the Stroggos defense systems. One of the
        techs begins to drop the reinforced pod door. &quot;Sleep
        tight, soldier. You&#146;ll see sunlight in less than six
        and a half hours. Not our sun, mind you&#133;&quot;
        &lt;SLAM&gt;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Pitch black except for the mild glow of
        your video readout system in front of you. You&#146;ve
        done this a dozen times in the sim classes. No sweat.
        Just a few short hours to sleep, recharge, and then&#133;
        the moment of glory. But this time it&#146;s for real.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It&#146;s also time to think. You
        recall your first official day of training, your unit
        commander discussing how these damn parasites made it to
        Earth and other nearby colonies in the first place. By
        employing our best satellites and long-range scanners, we
        learned how they traveled light years so quickly &#150;
        the Strogg used these black hole-like gateways as their
        highway to heaven. We still don&#146;t know if they
        created these rips in the fabric of space and time, or if
        they simply discovered them by accident. Either way&#133;
        it&#146;s just like opening the door to an
        all-you-can-eat restaurant for these bastards. In about
        two hours, we&#146;ll be entering the same interstellar
        portals, to hit &#145;em where it hurts&#133; on their
        own turf. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You close your eyes and relish this
        thought. Eventually, you nod off to the low hypnotic hum
        of the troop carrier.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">*Crackle* ... *fzzzz* ...
        &quot;Greetings to the people of the Coalition. This is
        Flag Admiral Crockett, speaking to you from the bridge
        deck of Phobos. We are entering the outer orbits of
        Stroggos, the alien&#146;s home system. As we had
        postulated, Stroggos&#146; atmosphere is harsh but
        breathable. We expect to make planetfall soon. Now is the
        time to switch on your debriefing panel if ya need
        it.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;Boomer?&quot; the voice crackles
        through every soldier&#146;s headset. &quot;Drop X-ray
        squad in 30 on my mark. You copy?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;Roger that!&quot; In another pod,
        your sergeant snaps back. &quot;OK boys and girls, you
        see the clock on your heads-up. Two demerits for anyone
        who up-chucks during bounce and roll!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">*Shthunk!!* Your drop pod is shot from
        the side of the carrier and hurtles downward.
        *Wheee-oooooo!* Incendiary atmosphere howls past the
        pod&#146;s rapidly heating shell. *Ka-WHUMP! * The pod
        wall suddenly buckles to your right, but stays intact.
        Another pod must have clipped yours on its way in. ECM
        didn't indicate enemy fire. Shit. Thrusters and
        stabilizing gyros are fading. Based on the pings, the
        other pods are pulling away. Below you, the large alien
        city roars into focus on the screen. But where are the
        other pods? They were there a minute ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Suddenly, distorted radio chatter
        lights up, &quot;Mayday! Mayday! Lost all power...
        shielding failed... missed dz... some kind of EMP is...
        kzzzt... us out. We're dropping like fli...
        zzzzkkkzzzt&quot;. Silence. Damn! If the Strogg have
        electromagnetic pulse defenses and we failed to detect
        them&#133; all of us are in the shitter. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">That HUGE blip has to be the Big Gun.
        You do a slow dogleg left as your navcomp finds a place
        to land when all of a sudden retros kick in and propel
        you south. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;What the...?&quot; Before you
        know it you skip across the lip of a crater and slam into
        a structure, a good distance away from your target. Dazed
        and bleeding from a head cut you toggle open the labeled
        arsenal bins and reach for where your gear ought to be
        stowed. Damn. Nothing but your sidearm. Damn again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You leap out the crushed pod door,
        alone, with blaster in hand, and tear off into the room
        with the bittersweet stench of vengeance coursing through
        your veins&#133;</font></p>
